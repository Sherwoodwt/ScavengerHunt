Sketch of project design

Animation - Theoretically, used to house animation effect scripts
- Wobble: Wobble back and forth, underutilized

Basketball - Basketball game related
- *Basketball: Animation script for basketball, just rotate and move to the right.
- *BasketballHoop: Animation, collision handling and score keeping logic for game.
- *HandleMiss: Resets Hoop score, destroys ball like hoop
- ThrowBasketball: Handles controller input and instantiates basketball at player

Inspectables - Handle how things are inspected by the player
- Grabbable: Give objects to player, allows for locking
- Inspectable: Interface with Inspect()
- *Playable: Plays audio, allows for locking - seems unnecessary...
- Questionable: Used for trivia answers, WIP
- Slurpable: Like Grabbable, but without needing to be inspected. DOESN'T IMPLEMENT INTERFACE
- Spawnable: Instantiates an object when inspected
- Talkable: Talks to player, can say multiple things, allows for locking
- *Textbox: Behaviour for textbox text writing - DOESN'T IMPLEMENT INTERFACE
- Transportable: Transports player on inspect

JayBoss
- GermControls: Control handling, physics, collision handling for GermControls
- HackGame: Game loop and logic for hack game. Spawns enemies, ends, restarts, counts points, plays sounds
- Mustache: Script for mustache enemies. Move along paths and kill player on collision
- ScaryJay: Big Script, handles Scary Jay cut scene, BREAK OUT THE DISABLE FUNCTIONALITY

Pogo - Theoretically scripts related to the Pogo game
- *KillPlayer: Sends player back to a spawn point on collision
- PogoController: Handle (simple) pogo controls, modify PogoPhysics
- PogoPhysics: Handle movement of pogoer, detect collisions with walls
- ZombiePhysics: Handle zombie physics/collisions

Pool - Pool scripts
- CueBall: Sends a cueball toward a point at a speed, killing it after a certain amount of time
- Fragment: Basically slurp but accumulates points in Pool game
- PoolBall: Chase the player, die when collide with projectile, kill player on collision with player
- PoolGame: Game logic for pool game, spawns balls, resets, on score quits game

Shuffle - Theoretically all scripts related to shuffle game
- ShuffleGame: Handles cutscene logic for shuffle game (jars under the bed)

Utilities - Utility bin
- *AutoDeselect: Auto-deselects a ui button on mouse button up. Not sure why it's here or if it's used
- CollisionDetection: Contains edge raycast math for box collision detection for movement
- *LayerUtils: Contains InLayerMask helper function that is only used in Basketball game for some reason
- PathMovement: Move along a list of points. If flippable, moves backwards too

Others - Top level junk, some of which could probably stay as such
- *BasePhysics: Base class for (currently) two different types of player movement, pogo and regular. This is
    apparently only used for generically allowing the camera to select the box collider and accel prop of these
    two components generically to allow for following the player.
- *BedMonster: When player enters collider, spawns a monster hand prefab and sets its path movement to move
    toward the player and back
- *MonsterHand: Goes with BedMonster, logic for hand that disables movement and drags player on collision
- CharacterController: Handle standard character controls and manipulate CharacterPhysics
- CharacterPhysics: Based on input vector, move object
- *Chase: Move toward target at a speed, handles flipping left/right based on direction
- *Detect: Detects collision and invokes event, used just in ChasePlayer for detection hitboxes
- DisableMovement: Detects player and turns off Physics inputs, used for cutscenes
- DisplayInventory: Handles cycling and refreshing item pictures in the inventory
- FollowPlayer: Follows the player, used by camera, can be overrided (like in cutscenes)
- FoosballPhysics:
