- WTF is the point of Pinky? Should I put a character in the backyard or something?

    it also fits contextually with each area
- Asta is buggy
- Spider trivia isn't finished and there's no real prize item

- Have all the stuff for a music game, need sounds and to code a game around it
- Refactor some of the code for sanity. Movement, Physics, any dangling components

Textbox changes
- Make it scaled correctly
